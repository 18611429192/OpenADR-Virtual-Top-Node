## OpenADR Virtual Top Node ##

The open-source OpenADR (OADR) Virtual Top Node software was developed to provide the electric power industry with an open-source research tool to demonstrate and test OpenADR 2.0 and to provide utilities with a tool to research the potential use of OpenADR 2.0 in different use cases. This server application is one example of how the OpenADR 2.0 specification can be applied. It includes a graphical user interface for setting up user accounts, assigning clients (virtual end nodes, or VENs), defining resources, selecting market contexts, and creating and scheduling demand response events. EPRI’s OADR VTN was developed and tested on an Ubuntu 14.04 desktop and server. Limited testing has been done on OS X. The software has not been tested on Windows Server, though all of the software used to run the OADR VTN runs on Windows. This user manual describes how to install and use EPRI’s open-source OpenADR VTN application.

## Notice
The EPRI OpenADR 2.0 Virtual Top Node (VTN) and VEN was designed with the advanced software that was available at that time. This software, like any others, has dependencies on third-party software packages. Some of these third-party software packages are deprecated.

Since its release in 2014, EPRI’s OpenADR 2.0 VTN has been downloaded over 6,700 times, supported numerous utility demonstration and field projects across the world, and has been implemented in commercial solutions. While EPRI has decided to discontinue support for the current version of EPRI OpenADR VTN due to deprecated software packages offered by the third parties, the code will remain on EPRI’s GitHub page as an example for others who are interested in seeing an example implementation. EPRI will continue to explore how to continue support to such software tools.
