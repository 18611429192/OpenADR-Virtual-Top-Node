## OpenADR Virtual Top Node ##

The open-source OpenADR (OADR) Virtual Top Node software was developed to provide the electric power industry with an open-source research tool to demonstrate and test OpenADR 2.0 and to provide utilities with a tool to research the potential use of OpenADR 2.0 in different use cases. This server application is one example of how the OpenADR 2.0 specification can be applied. It includes a graphical user interface for setting up user accounts, assigning clients (virtual end nodes, or VENs), defining resources, selecting market contexts, and creating and scheduling demand response events. EPRI’s OADR VTN was developed and tested on an Ubuntu 14.04 desktop and server. Limited testing has been done on OS X. The software has not been tested on Windows Server, though all of the software used to run the OADR VTN runs on Windows. This user manual describes how to install and use EPRI’s open-source OpenADR VTN application.
